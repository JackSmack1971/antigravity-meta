# shadcn/ui

## Overview

A framework for building high-quality UI components and design systems. Components are added as source code to the project via the CLI, allowing for full customization and ownership.

## 📚 Resources

| Resource | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [Critical Rules](file:///C:/workspaces/antigravity-meta/.agents/skills/shadcn/resources/shadcn-critical-rules.md) | Styling, forms, and composition rules. |
| [Patterns & Selection](file:///C:/workspaces/antigravity-meta/.agents/skills/shadcn/resources/shadcn-patterns-and-selection.md) | Map of needs to components and code examples. |
| [CLI & Workflow](file:///C:/workspaces/antigravity-meta/.agents/skills/shadcn/resources/shadcn-cli-and-workflow.md) | Initialization, adding components, and smart merging. |

## Core Principles

1. **Use existing components first**: Search the registry before writing custom UI.
2. **Compose, don't reinvent**: Build pages by composing Tabs, Cards, and Forms.
3. **Use semantic tokens**: Prefer `bg-primary` and `text-muted` over raw colors.
4. **Follow accessibility rules**: All overlays must have titles; use `asChild` for triggers.

## Quick CLI Reference

- **Refresh Context**: `npx shadcn@latest info`
- **Search Registry**: `npx shadcn@latest search`
- **Add Component**: `npx shadcn@latest add <component>`
- **View Docs**: `npx shadcn@latest docs <component>`
